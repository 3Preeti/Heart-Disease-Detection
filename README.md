# Heart-Disease-Detection

A machine learning-based system for predicting the likelihood of heart disease by analyzing patient health data, helping healthcare professionals make early and informed decisions.

## Overview

This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict heart disease risks by analyzing various health parameters such as:
- Age
- Blood Pressure
- Cholesterol Levels
- Lifestyle Factors

Using advanced classification algorithms, the system identifies patterns and risk factors in patient data, assisting healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and timely intervention.

## Features

- **Multiple Algorithms**: Implements Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Neural Networks.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Processes health data to highlight key risk factors.
- **User-Centric Design**: Supports healthcare professionals in making accurate predictions and personalized treatment plans.
- **Improved Outcomes**: Aims to reduce the risk of severe heart conditions through early detection.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - Scikit-learn
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib/Seaborn
- **Data**: [Heart Disease Dataset](heart-disease.csv)
