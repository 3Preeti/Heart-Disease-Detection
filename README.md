# Heart-Disease-Detection

A heart disease detection system utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients by analyzing various health parameters, such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and lifestyle factors. Using classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Neural Networks, the system processes patient data to identify patterns and risk factors. This predictive model assists healthcare professionals in early diagnosis, enabling timely intervention and personalized treatment plans, thereby improving patient outcomes and reducing the risk of severe heart conditions.
